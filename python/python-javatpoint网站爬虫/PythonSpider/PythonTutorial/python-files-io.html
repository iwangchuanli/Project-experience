<h1 class="h1">Python File Handling </h1>
<p>Till now, we were taking the input from the console and writing it back to the console to interact with the user.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is not enough to only display the data on the console. The data to be displayed may be very large, and only a limited amount of data can be displayed on the console, and since the memory is volatile, it is impossible to recover the programmatically generated data again and again.</p>
<p>However, if we need to do so, we may store it onto the local file system which is volatile and can be accessed every time. Here, comes the need of file handling.</p>
<p>In this section of the tutorial, we will learn all about file handling in python including, creating a file, opening a file, closing a file, writing and appending the file, etc.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Opening a file </h2>
<p>Python provides the open() function which accepts two arguments, file name and access mode in which the file is accessed. The function returns a file object which can be used to perform various operations like reading, writing, etc.</p>
<p>The syntax to use the open() function is given below.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea class="python" name="code">
file object = open(&lt;file-name&gt;, &lt;access-mode&gt;, &lt;buffering&gt;)   
</textarea></div>
<p>The files can be accessed using various modes like read, write, or append. The following are the details about the access mode to open a file.</p>
