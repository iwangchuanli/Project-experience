<h1 class="h1">Python Operators </h1>
<p>The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in a particular programming language. Python provides a variety of operators described as follows. </p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Arithmetic operators </li>
<li>Comparison operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Membership Operators </li>
<li>Identity Operators </li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Arithmetic operators </h2>
<p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations between two operands. It includes +(addition), - (subtraction), *(multiplication), /(divide), %(reminder), //(floor division), and exponent (**). </p>
<p>Consider the following table for a detailed explanation of arithmetic operators. </p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>+ (Addition)</strong></td>
<td>It is used to add two operands. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a+b = 30  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>- (Subtraction)</strong></td>
<td>It is used to subtract the second operand from the first operand. If the first operand is less than the second operand, the value result negative. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt;  a ? b = 10   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/ (divide) </strong></td>
<td>It returns the quotient after dividing the first operand by the second operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a/b = 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>* (Multiplication)</strong></td>
<td>It is used to multiply one operand with the other. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a * b = 200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>% (reminder)</strong></td>
<td>It returns the reminder after dividing the first operand by the second operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a%b = 0 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>** (Exponent)</strong></td>
<td>It is an exponent operator represented as it calculates the first operand power to second operand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>// (Floor division)</strong></td>
<td>It gives the floor value of the quotient produced by dividing the two operands.  </td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Comparison operator </h2>
<p>Comparison operators are used to comparing the value of the two operands and returns boolean true or false accordingly. The comparison operators are described in the following table. </p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>If the value of two operands is equal, then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!=</td>
<td>If the value of two operands is not equal then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;=</td>
<td>If the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand, then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;=</td>
<td>If the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand, then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;&gt;</td>
<td>If the value of two operands is not equal, then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>If the first operand is greater than the second operand, then the condition becomes true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>&lt;</strong></td>
<td>If the first operand is less than the second operand, then the condition becomes true.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Python assignment operators </h2>
<p>The assignment operators are used to assign the value of the right expression to the left operand. The assignment operators are described in the following table. </p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>= </td>
<td>It assigns the the value of the right expression to the left operand.   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+= </td>
<td>It increases the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and assign the modified value back to left operand. For example, if a = 10, b = 20 =&gt; a+ = b will be equal to a = a+ b and therefore, a = 30.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-=</td>
<td>It decreases the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and assign the modified value back to left operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a- = b will be equal to a = a- b and therefore, a = 10.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*=</td>
<td>It multiplies the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and assign the modified value back to left operand. For example, if a = 10, b = 20 =&gt; a* = b will be equal to a = a* b and therefore, a = 200.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%=</td>
<td>It divides the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and assign the reminder back to left operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 =&gt; a % = b will be equal to a = a % b and therefore, a = 0.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**=</td>
<td>a**=b will be equal to a=a**b, for example, if a = 4, b =2, a**=b will assign 4**2 = 16 to a.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>//=</td>
<td>A//=b will be equal to a = a// b, for example, if a = 4, b = 3, a//=b will assign 4//3 = 1 to a. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Bitwise operator </h2>
<p>The bitwise operators perform bit by bit operation on the values of the two operands.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> </p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea class="python" name="code">
if a = 7;
   b = 6; 
then, binary (a) = 0111
	binary (b) = 0011

hence, a &amp; b = 0011
	  a | b = 0111
             a ^ b = 0100
	   ~ a = 1000
