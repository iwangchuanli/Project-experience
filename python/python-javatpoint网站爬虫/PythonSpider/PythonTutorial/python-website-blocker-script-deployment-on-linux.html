<h1 class="h1">Script deployment on Linux</h1>
<p>Hence, we are done with the python script (blocker.py) which is running fine. This is the time to deploy this script at system startup.</p>
<p>The process to deploy a script to run at startup depends upon the operating system. In this section of the tutorial, we will describe the process for Linux and windows.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Procedure </h2>
<p>To schedule a script to run at startup on Linux, we need to configure the entry in the <strong>crontab</strong> schedule. </p>
<p>The crontab can be defined as the list that contains the commands that are to be run on a regular schedule. The crontab stands for cron table which is a set schedule according to which the script is executed on a regular interval.</p>
<p>Follow the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>Open the crontab with the -e flag. Run the following command on the terminal on Linux.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea class="python" name="code">
$ sudo crontab -e 
</textarea></div>
<p>This will open a crontab file which looks like following. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2 </strong></p>
<p>Now add the following line to the file and save it. </p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea class="python" name="code">
@reboot python3 /home/javatpoint/Desktop/Python/website_blocker/blocker.py
</textarea></div>

<p><strong>Step 3 </strong></p>
<p>Restart the system now. On reboot, our script blocker.py is scheduled to run at system start-up. As of now, we are in working hours. So let's try to open the Facebook on the browser.</p>
<img alt="Script deployment on Linux" src="python/images/python-website-blocker-script-deployment-on-linux3.png"/>
<p>As shown in the above image, the website www.facebook.com is refused to connect. Hence, our script is working fine on the system start-up as the website is refused to connect. </p>
