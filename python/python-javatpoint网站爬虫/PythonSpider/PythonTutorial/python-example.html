<h1 class="h1">First Python Program </h1>
<p>In this Section, we will discuss the basic syntax of python by using which, we will run a simple program to print hello world on the console. </p>
<p>Python provides us the two ways to run a program: </p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Using Interactive interpreter prompt </li>
<li>Using a script file</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's discuss each one of them in detail. </p>
<h2 class="h2">Interactive interpreter prompt </h2>
<p>Python provides us the feature to execute the python statement one by one at the interactive prompt. It is preferable in the case where we are concerned about the output of each line of our python program. </p>
<p>To open the interactive mode, open the terminal (or command prompt) and type python (python3 in case if you have python2 and python3 both installed on your system). </p>
<p>It will open the following prompt where we can execute the python statement and check their impact on the console. </p>
<img alt="First Python Program" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/first-python-program.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Let's run a python statement to print the traditional hello world on the console. Python3 provides print() function to print some message on the console. We can pass the message as a string into this function. Consider the following image. </p>
<img alt="First Python Program" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/first-python-program2.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Here, we get the message <strong>"Hello World !"</strong> printed on the console. </p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Using a script file </h2>
<p>Interpreter prompt is good to run the individual statements of the code. However, we can not write the code every-time on the terminal. </p>
<p>We need to write our code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, open an editor like notepad, create a file named first.py (python used .py extension) and write the following code in it. </p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea class="python" name="code">
Print ("hello world"); #here, we have used print() function to print the message on the console. 
</textarea></div>
<p>To run this file named as first.py, we need to run the following command on the terminal. </p>
<p><strong>$ python3 first.py</strong></p>
<img alt="First Python Program" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/first-python-program3.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Hence, we get our output as the message <strong>Hello World !</strong> is printed on the console. </p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="h2">Get Started with PyCharm </h2>
<p>In our first program, we have used gedit on our CentOS as an editor. On Windows, we have an alternative like notepad or notepad++ to edit the code. However, these editors are not used as IDE for python since they are unable to show the syntax related suggestions. </p>
<p>JetBrains provides the most popular and a widely used cross-platform IDE <strong>PyCharm</strong> to run the python programs. </p>
<h2 class="h2">PyCharm installation</h2>
<p>As we have already stated, PyCharm is a cross-platform IDE, and hence it can be installed on a variety of the operating systems. In this section of the tutorial, we will cover the installation process of PyCharm on Windows, MacOS, CentOS, and Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Windows </h3>
<p>Installing PyCharm on Windows is very simple.
