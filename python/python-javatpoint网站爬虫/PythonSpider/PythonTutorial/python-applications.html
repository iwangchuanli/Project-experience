<h1 class="h1">Python Applications</h1>
<p>Python is known for its general purpose nature that makes it applicable in almost each domain of software development. Python as a whole can be used in any sphere of development.</p>
<p>Here, we are specifing applications areas where python can be applied.</p>
<h4 class="h4">1) Web Applications</h4>
<p> We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser etc. It also provides Frameworks such as Django, Pyramid, Flask etc to design and delelop web based applications. Some important developments are: PythonWikiEngines, Pocoo, PythonBlogSoftware etc.</p>
<h4 class="h4">2) Desktop GUI Applications</h4>
<p>Python provides Tk GUI library to develop user interface in python based application. Some other useful toolkits wxWidgets, Kivy, pyqt that are useable on several platforms. The Kivy is popular for writing multitouch applications.</p>
<h4 class="h4">3) Software Development </h4>
<p>Python is helpful for software development process. It works as a support language and can be used for build control and management, testing etc.</p>
<h4 class="h4">4) Scientific and Numeric</h4>
<p>Python is popular and widely used in scientific and numeric computing. Some useful library and package are SciPy, Pandas, IPython etc. SciPy is group of packages of engineering, science and mathematics. </p>
<h4 class="h4">5) Business Applications </h4>
<p>Python is used to build Bussiness applications like ERP and e-commerce systems. Tryton is a high level application platform.</p>
<h4 class="h4">6) Console Based Application</h4>
<p> We can use Python to develop console based applications. For example: <b>IPython</b>.</p>
<h4 class="h4">7) Audio or Video based Applications</h4>
<p> Python is awesome to perform multiple tasks and can be used to develop multimedia applications. Some of real applications are: TimPlayer, cplay etc.</p>
<h4 class="h4">8) 3D CAD Applications</h4>
<p> To create CAD application Fandango is a real application which provides full features of CAD.</p>
<h4 class="h4">9) Enterprise Applications</h4>
<p>Python can be used to create applications which can be used within an Enterprise or an Organization. Some real time applications are: OpenErp, Tryton, Picalo etc.</p>
<h4 class="h4">10) Applications for Images</h4>
<p> Using Python several application can be developed for image. Applications developed are: VPython, Gogh, imgSeek etc.</p>
<p>There are several such applications which can be developed using Python</p>
