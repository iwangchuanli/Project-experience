<h1 class="h1">How to Install Python (Environment Set-up) </h1>
<p>In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss the installation of python on various operating systems. </p>
<h2 class="h2">Installation on Windows </h2>
<p>Visit the link <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>https://www.python.org/downloads/</em></a> to download the latest release of Python. In this process, we will install Python 3.6.7 on our Windows operating system.</p>

<br/>
<p>Double-click the executable file which is downloaded; the following window will open. Select Customize installation and proceed. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up2.png"/>
<br/>
<p>The following window shows all the optional features. All the features need to be installed and are checked by default; we need to click next to continue. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up3.png"/>
<br/>
<p>The following window shows a list of advanced options. Check all the options which you want to install and click next. Here, we must notice that the first check-box (install for all users) must be checked. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up4.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Now, we are ready to install python-3.6.7. Let's install it. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up5.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Now, try to run python on the command prompt. Type the command <strong>python</strong> in case of python2 or python3 in case of <strong>python3</strong>. It will show an error as given in the below image. It is because we haven't set the path. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up6.png"/>
<br/>
<p>To set the path of python, we need to the right click on "my computer" and go to Properties ¡ú Advanced ¡ú Environment Variables.  </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up7.png"/>
<br/>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up8.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Add the new path variable in the user variable section. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up9.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Type <strong>PATH</strong> as the variable name and set the path to the installation directory of the python shown in the below image. </p>
<img alt="Python Environment Set-up" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/python/images/python-environment-set-up10.png"/>
<br/>
<p>Now, the path is set, we are ready to run python on our local system. Restart CMD, and type <strong>python</strong> again. It will open the python interpreter shell where we can execute the python statements. </p>
