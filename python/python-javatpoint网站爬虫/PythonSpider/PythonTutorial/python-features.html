<h1 class="h1">Python Features</h1>
<p>Python provides lots of features that are listed below.</p>
<h4 class="h4">1) Easy to Learn and Use</h4>
<p>Python is easy to learn and use. It is developer-friendly and high level programming language.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">2) Expressive Language</h4>
<p> Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">3) Interpreted Language</h4>
<p> Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">4) Cross-platform Language</h4>
<p>Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">5) Free and Open Source</h4>
<p> Python language is freely available at <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank">offical web address</a>.The source-code is also available. Therefore it is open source.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">6) Object-Oriented Language</h4>
<p> Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">7) Extensible</h4>
<p>It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">8) Large Standard Library</h4>
<p>Python has a large and broad library and prvides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development. </p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">9) GUI Programming Support</h4>
<p>Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 class="h4">10) Integrated</h4>
<p> It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc.</p>
