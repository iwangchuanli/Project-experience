The work breakdown structure is a method of structuring work 
scope.  It is the first activity that is undertaken when dealing with 
projects and breaks the project into manageable sections.


For this assignment you are required to examine the whole project 
and provide a WBS to three levels for the whole project and 
selecting one area only provide a 4th level.


The way you break the project down is up to you and it must make 
sense.


Attached are the notes on WBS and they are repoduced here


I can not get onto eeserver so this information is also in the U drive 
of the NT's under EPM444

<paraindent><param>left</param></italic></bold>These methods attempt to successively 
refine the definition of scope.  They are 
the most common method of scope 
organisation.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>These methods are useful in providing 
scope checklists and allow for detail to 
grow with the project.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>Other requirements for these systems 
include:</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>Manageable where specific authority and 
responsibility can be assigned</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>Independent or with minimal interfacing 
with other elements</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>can be integrated to give an overall 
picture</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>Measurable in terms of progress.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>They however can create divisions in 
organisations as to the split of work 
responsibilities.  Care should be used in 
designing these systems to ensure 
interface points are defined and agreed.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>These structures can also grow in size 
at a rapid rate leading the generation of 
"clerical monsters".</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param><bold><italic>TYPICAL STRUCTURES</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param></italic></bold>Structures vary from one organisation to 
another and one project to another.  A 
hierarchical structure may comprise:</paraindent>


<center><bold>Level
<center>Description

<center></bold>1
Total Program

<center>2
Project

<center>3
Task

<center>4
Subtask

<center>5
Work Package

<center>6
Level of Effort



<paraindent><param>left</param>The upper three levels are usually 
specified by the client.  Level 1 is 
usually used for authorisation and 
release of all work, budgets are 
prepared at level 2, schedules at level 3.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>The top 3 levels represent integrated 
efforts and should not be applied to a 
department.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>The summation of all elements in one 
level must be the sum of all work on the 
next lowest level.  Each element of work 
should only be assigned to one and only 
one level of effort.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>left</param>In setting up a system, the following 
should be considered:</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>The technical and complexity 
requirements of the program</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>The program cost.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>The time span of the program.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>The executor's resource requirements.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>Customer and contractor internal 
management control and reporting 
structures.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>out</param>Number of organisations involved in the 
project.</paraindent>
